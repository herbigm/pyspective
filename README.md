# PySpective - An Open-Source Tool for Processing Spectroscopic Data

The analysis of spectroscopic data is an essential part of research and education in chemistry.  Commercial software is often used for this purpose. For reasons of cost, however, there are not always sufficient licenses available for education, or the software license is bound to the hardware of the spectrometer. 
The use of open source software, such as the ubiquitous programming language Python, represents an alternative to the use of commercial software. However, programming is not reasonable for all users, which is why a user-friendly software solution is needed. Some solutions for special measurement data already exist: [NMRium](https://www.nmrium.org/) and [ssNake](https://www.ru.nl/science/magneticresonance/software/ssnake/) for NMR spectroscopy, [ProteoWizard](https://proteowizard.sourceforge.io/) for mass spectrometry and [SupraFit](https://github.com/conradhuebler/SupraFit) for model fitting, among others. 

PySpective is made for the evaluation of spectroscopic data, such as IR, Raman, UV/VIS and XRF spectroscopy, is written in Python and can therefore be used platform-independently and without licensing problems. Due to its status as an open-source project, extensions and enhancement requests by users can be implemented by a community of developers.  The recommendations of [NFDI4Chem](https://knowledgebase.nfdi4chem.de/knowledge_base/docs/
	synthetic_chemistry/) are implemented.
